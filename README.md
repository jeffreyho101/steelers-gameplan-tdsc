# Tartan Data Science Cup, Fall 2017 - Team McNuggets

### Overview
This repository consists of findings produced by Jeffrey Ho, Christian Manaog, and James Yan; we are all third-year Carnegie Mellon students. The files listed are all a part of our final submission to the Fall 2017 Tartan Data Science Cup. We presented to ESPN Senior Analyst [Brian Burke](http://espnmediazone.com/us/bios/brian-burke/) and Carnegie Mellon faculty/PhD students. We earned 2nd place overall in the Tartan Data Science Cup.

### Objective
The person who stole [JuJu Smith-Schuster](http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster)'s bike also stole our gameplan for tonight. We're meeting at 5pm to create a new gameplan. Please bring us a document with anything you can find using NFL data that will help improve our chances of winning tonight vs. DET. We're short on time, so keep it under three pages of analysis

Added half way through: We are considering incorporating receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster (abbreviated as J.Smith-Schuster) more into the offense. What is your recommendation? Please address this question in your gameplan for tonight, and still keep it under three pages of analysis

### Abstract of Proposed Gameplan
We have been tasked to create a new gameplan for tonight’s game against the Detroit Lions, given only the [nflscrapR](https://ryurko.github.io/nflscrapR-data/) dataset. In our report, we will break down effiective overall game strategies in order for the Steelers to come out on top. Offensively, we will detail strategies to break down the Lions’ Defense, Le’Veon Bell’s running habits, Clutch Time offense, and JuJu Smith-Schuster’s potential impact on tonight’s game. Defensively, we will emphasize the containment of Matthew Stafford and the Detroit offense’s play selection on third down. Hopefully with the use of our gameplan strategies, the Steelers will come out on top!

Note that our final report is a three-page condensed subset of our findings, which are all documented in the repository's R code (rmd file). 

Additional note: During our final round presentation, I stated that based on my analysis of Juju Smith-Schuster, he would have a "field day" under mostly single coverage against the Lions. Smith-Schuster did indeed have a career night, highlighted by a 97-yard touchdown reception. Not only is he the youngest current NFL player, but he also broke the record for the Pittsburgh Steelers' longest recorded touchdown play.
